# Getting and Cleaning Data Project Codebook 

This Codebook details the data used in the project for the **_Getting and Cleaning Data_** Coursera course.
Topics covered here include:
* Description of the raw source data
* Data transformations performed 
* Description of the tidy dataset produced 

## Raw Source Data
### Background information
The source data is from a study that collected measure from the accelerometers of participants that were performing a variety of activities while wearing the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the study is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

### Raw data files
The data files are available as a zip archive that the run_analysis.R script will download from:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The archive will then be unzipped into a subdirectory named **/data**.  The subdirectory will be created if 
it does note exist.  The unzipped files will be placed into a subdirectory named **/data/UCI HAR Dataset**.
The complete listing of unzipped files is:

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
